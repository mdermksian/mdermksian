Photoville is a yearly photography expo that goes on in Brooklyn Bridge Park. Luceo Images was doing an exhibit highlighting the rate of overdose in the United States. This number has been climing exponentially for years, and is reaching catastrophic levels. Roughly 64,000 people died in 2016 and over 72,000 died in 2017. This amounts to one person every 7 minutes and 19 seconds. Full details on the exhibit can be found <a href="http://photoville.com/64000-2/" target="_blank" style="color:blue;">here</a>.

To bring awareness this tragic fact, Luceo came up with the idea for a photography exhibit in which every 7 minutes and 18 seconds a ball would drop onto a bell and fall into a river of metal balls representing the countless people who have died from drug overdoses. With each bell ring, one of the 200 portraits lining the walls would turn red. The following is a picture of the final exhibit:

###Engineering Inputs
Luceo brought me and a friend in to implement the engineering components needed to make the exhibit function. They had purchased a motor and controller, but needed help getting them running and integrated into the system.
