This website was built using the framework established by Gatsby.js. Gatsby.js allows developers to create static webpages using the powerful templating tools in React.js and the powerful API/database tools in GraphQL. All the components of this website were custom built and styled by me.

I debated whether or not to use a service like Squarespace or Wix to quickly develop a portfolio site using drag-and-drop tools, but ultimately realized that I had all the necessary skills to do it myself. This way, I have intimate control over how everything looks. I can put a personal flair on the website that might not be available through other services. Feel free to check back over time and look at the changes I've made.
