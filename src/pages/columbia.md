I attended Columbia University's School of Engineering and Applied Science to complete my undergraduate degree. I obtained a Bachelor of Science, majoring in biomedical engineering with a focus on biomechanics and minoring in mechanical engineering.

Over the course of my four years of Columbia I grew immensely personally and professionally. I entered with very little idea of what I wanted to accomplish. I had some thoughts of pursuing medical school, but not with any strong focus. As I worked my way through my freshman and sophomore years, struggling with many of the pre-med courses, I realized that the most exciting course material for me was actually on the engineering side of medicine. I became more and more interested in mechanisms and devices, and developed an immense appreciation for the engineers who designed the devices our doctors use.

As I worked through my junior and senior years, I took more and more courses focused on biomechanics and realized that focusing only on biomedical engineering wouldn't enable me to successfully design medical devices. I began to incorporate mechanical engineering courses to supplement this goal. The final pivotal moment in my time at Columbia occurred in the first semester of my senior year, when I decided to take Classical Control Systems. This course opened my eyes to the idea of feedback control and planted a seed in my mind of one day developing "smart" medical devices capable of autonomous control.

These experiences culminated in an interesting senior capstone project which I've described <a href="/hip-cpm" style="color:blue;">here</a>. The project incorporated mechanical modeling, design, and manufacture. It also gave me an opportunity to perform simple control of a motor.
