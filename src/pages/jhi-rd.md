###What I Do
In February of 2018 I changed departments at Jarvik Heart to Research & Development. My focus in this position has been primarily on product development. To meet customer needs, I've developed various accessories and supporting medical devices for the Jarvik Ventricular Assist System (VAS).

I author design input and output documentation, perform verification and validation testing, and generate regulatory submissions for various countries across the world. I've gotten an opportunity to apply my skills in engineering analysis and statistical analysis, and am constantly looking for new and innovative solutions to meet the needs of the business and the patient.

###What I've Learned So Far
I've become well versed in design controls under ISO 13485:2016 and FDA's CFR Title 21 Part 820. I've learned to write effective protocols and reports with statistical analyses. Moreover, I've learned the value of design and development for a small engineering company. Design and development is a company's long term investment in its future success. To a large extent, development engineers dictate what the company will look like in the coming years. It's this meaningful impact that I've come to find addictive about my job.
