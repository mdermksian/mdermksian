After several years of working, I decided to return to school to obtain a Master's degree in mechanical engineering, focusing on robotics and control systems. Unlike in my undergraduate years, I now had a clear goal and focus for my studies: form a rich understanding of control systems, dynamics, and robotics to enable my dream of developing robotic medical devices. Over my time at CMU, I have had the opportunity to work on interesting <a href="/projects" style="color:blue;">projects</a> that have allowed me to apply the knowledge gained in the courses below.


### Selected Course Work:
- 24-677: Linear Control Systems
