At some point in my life - and I don't remember when - cheese became a part of my identity. My family knows I love cheese, my friends know I love cheese, everyone knows I love cheese. I can't pinpoint what it is that I love so much about it, but I've yet to find a cheese that I don't like. In early 2016, I saw some videos of people making cheese and developed a strong desire to try it. This is a picture of my first ever cheese, a Monterey Jack:

Since then I've made Mozzarella, Feta, Colby, and want to make more and more. I've always been a fan of hard work and delayed gratification, and cheesemaking takes those two things to an extreme. It takes several days of work just to form the cheese and then months of patient waiting as it ages. At the end, a beautiful wheel of cheese is your reward.
