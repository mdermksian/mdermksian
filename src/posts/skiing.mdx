Skiing is my favorite sport. I've been skiing since before I can remember. My family has a house in Vermont that we visit regularly in the winter, and I've recently started making trips out West. It's my dream to ski all over the world: Canada, Japan, Europe, and South America, just to name a few. Below are pictures and videos I've taken while skiing:
