### What I Did
My second summer at Riverside Orthopaedic and Sports Medicine was focused on surgical billing, and gave a better insight into the work involved in the business side of the private practice. I worked intimately with the billing supervisor to help resolve unpaid insurance claims, and I interfaced extensively with the office manager to help organize the practice's surgical billing system.

The office utilized an online system called AthenaNet to manage all of their electronic health records and medical billing. AthenaNet was able to track insurance claims and identify items that hadn't been closed for various reasons. It was essentially my job to go through the list of unresolved insurance claims, identify why they had not been closed, and do whatever was in my power to resolve the claim. Occasionally, insurance companies would refuse to pay the bill because the practice's record did not align with theirs. Simple typos in home address or date of birth could hold up a payment. More often, however, there were more complex reasons for denied claims. I had to work with both inside office personnel and outside insurance personnel to identify and reconcile errors.

One major source of inefficiency I identified came through the process the doctors used to author surgical bills. The doctors had a physical form they would fill out by hand and then manually scan into the AthenaNet system. This led to issues with legibility when reading the scanned form and generated unnecessary paperwork for employees. I worked with AthenaHealth to create a custom surgical billing form within AthenaNet that allowed the doctors to input information directly into the system.

### What I Learned
I learned a great deal in this second summer about medical practices and insurance companies. I also began to hone my interpersonal skills. More importantly, however, this summer clarified for me exactly where my interests lied. Up until this point, I had been intent on studying medicine. I began to realize, however, that I was more interested in being behind the scenes of medicine. Rather than being the person who implants the medical devices, I wanted to design and market them. It was at this point that I started to take a career in medical devices engineering seriously.
