Food and cooking are a big part of my life. My family ate dinner together every day growing up. My mom has always cooked and baked for me and my siblings, and she has passed on a lot of her knowledge. I get a lot of joy out of making something delicious and being able to share it with my friends and family. Just as it is for many people, food is a symbol of togetherness and joy for me.
